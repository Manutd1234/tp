TrackCall helps membership secretaries keep their organisation's member records up to date.
It is a desktop app for a roster of up to 500 members. Type commands to find members,
update contact details, and organise groups without editing each record one at a time.

## Planned features

* Add and edit member records with `add` and `edit`, and view or remove records as needed.
* Find members by name and narrow the results by group tags.
* Add or remove a tag for everyone in the displayed list with one command.
* Look up command syntax with `help` or `help [COMMAND]`, and save changes to a local data file automatically.

## Planned interface

This is a mockup of the intended product. It keeps AB3's command box, result display,
member list, and data-file status bar. The TrackCall features above are planned;
the current application still contains the AB3 starter behaviour.

The Developer Guide describes the planned requirements. The User Guide still describes
the starter application and will be updated as TrackCall features are implemented.

## Local development

Use Java 25. Start the application with:

```shell
./gradlew run
```

Run the automated tests with:

```shell
./gradlew test
```

See the [setup instructions](docs/SettingUp.md) for the full development setup.
